skyssappbeta
============

Hackety-hack android app for Skyss timetables/stops crafted together in a hurry as there were no official alternative in 2011. Beta app (no longer working as Skyss have changed their urls/pages). Published here for the sake of example.

The application probably wont work without doing additional changes. Contains some new UI that were never released to Google Play. Good luck!
